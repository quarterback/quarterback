## What I Do

I design decision architectures for human-AI systems—who decides what, when, and with what authority.

This work grows from 15+ years in service design, civic tech, and HCI research. Most system failures aren't interface problems—they're judgment routing problems. Wrong actor, wrong information, wrong authority structure.

**Research areas:**
- **Preference architecture**: Constraint design that reveals true intent (Stratified Preference Allocation)
- **Trust infrastructure**: Portable reputation and shared moderation (Glowrm)
- **Agentic economics**: The hidden costs of AI decision-making (Occupant Index)
- **Disclosure systems**: Making AI decisions legible for public accountability (Tardigrade, AI Statements)
- **Delegation frameworks**: When humans stay in the loop, when they don't (Judgment Routing)

**The core insight:** Traditional design assumes human decision-makers. AI doesn't just change the interface—it changes who decides. My work formalizes what designers used to do intuitively: structuring authority, information flow, and trust.

## Projects

### Decision & Trust Systems

**[Stratified Preference Allocation (SPA)](https://github.com/quarterback/frameworks)** — Matching architecture that replaces unlimited swipes with scarce, tiered signals. Forces honest preference revelation, reduces spam. Works across dating, hiring, networking—anywhere matching happens.

Reference implementations: [HeyPBJ](https://heypbj.lovable.app) (dating) · [Leafroll](https://leafroll.bolt.host/) (professional networking)

**[Glowrm](https://drydown.replit.app/documentation)** — Trust infrastructure for ATProto: portable reputation, shared moderation, SPA-based resource allocation

**[KizuKizu](https://kizukizu.club)** — Relational profiling around connection archetypes. How you connect, not just who you are.

**[Judgment Routing](https://github.com/quarterback/judgment-routing)** — Prototypes for delegated authority in agentic systems. When should a machine decide? When should a human?

### Research & Analysis

**[Occupant Index](https://occupant.ee)** — AI cost intelligence tracking the "Judgment Premium" in reasoning model pricing

Reasoning-class models (o1, DeepSeek-R1) have different economics than commodity inference. The Occupant Index tracks what aggregate "AI cost deflation" narratives miss: organizations building on AI judgment are taking an unhedged position on pricing that isn't deflating like they expect.

### Delivery & Public Systems

**[Portland Digital Corps](https://digitalcorpspdx.org)** — Civic tech sprint. Six Oregon organizations, 100+ participants, shipped projects.  
[GitHub](https://github.com/Digital-Corps-PDX) · [Final Report](https://digitalcorpspdx.org/report)

**[Design For The Public 2024](https://www.designforthepublic.com/)** — Two-day conference on public interest design and service delivery

**[Tardigrade](https://digital-corps-pdx.github.io/tardigrade/)** �� Open disclosure patterns for AI systems: badges, contestability, human oversight indicators

**[AI Statements](https://aistatements.org/)** — Standardized AI usage disclosures

**[Consequence Design](https://consequencedesign.org)** — Framework for post-deployment harms, institutional erosion, and the DIRE methodology

### Tools & Systems Design

**[Oregon HS Tennis Rankings](https://oregontennis.org)** — Power Index rankings, playoff simulator, league analysis

A complete analytical system: adjusted win percentage (APR), strength of schedule (SOS), flight-weighted scoring (FWS). Fair, transparent team rankings. Built because ranking systems are decision architectures—they encode what we value and who gets opportunities.
