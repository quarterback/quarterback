## Projects

### Allocation, Trust & Matching

Allocation, Trust & Matching
Stratified Preference Allocation (SPA) — A way to make people mean what they signal. Instead of unlimited likes or swipes, you get a limited budget and have to decide how to spend it. Works for dating, hiring, networking—anywhere matching happens.
Reference implementations: HeyPBJ (dating) · Leafroll (professional networking)
Glowrm — Reputation that follows you across apps. Get banned from one platform, it shows up when you try to join another. Built for ATProto.
KizuKizu — A way to describe how you connect with people, not just who you are.
Judgment Routing — When should a machine decide, and when should a human? Prototypes for drawing that line.

**[Stratified Preference Allocation (SPA)](https://github.com/quarterback/frameworks)** — Matching architecture that replaces unlimited swipes/likes with scarce, tiered signals. Forces preference revelation, reduces spam, works across domains.
