# Hi, I’m Ron

Internet researcher & critical designer. My core background is in 

I've been building stuff online since 1995. I'm interested in the ways technology distorts public life, and these days, concern myself with both platform economics, implementation & maintainence of public software and thinking aloud about ways to interrupt the rapid-scale harm being wrought on everyday life by disinvested grifters detached from the consequences of their decisions. Despite all of that, I'm legitimately fun at parties. 
I spent over a decade as a civil servant at the local, state & federal level, most recently at <a href="https://18f.org">18F</a>. I'm also an Air Force veteran.

### 🔬 Research & Practice

**Design Theory, Inquiry & Critical Practice**
- Design as a mode of inquiry and critique
- Discursive and critical design (designing arguments, not artifacts)
- Pedagogies of civic competence and public-sector design literacy
- Context engineering, agent experience, and post-interface decision spaces
- Hype studies: how technological promises reshape expectations and institutions

**Governance, State Capacity & Public Service Delivery**
- Digital transformation grounded in the mechanics of implementation
- Service delivery as the true locus of governance (not strategy decks)
- Administrative friction, platform entrapment, and Exitory Design
- Comparative models of state capability and public value
- Procurement, vendor ecosystems, and the political economy of delivery
- Failures as diagnostic tools for understanding the state

**Socio-Technical Systems, Coordination & Knowledge**
- Organizational memory, tacit knowledge, and decision latency
- Interagency collaboration and multi-actor delivery
- Cybernetic planning, feedback rituals, and pseudo-participation
- Knowledge infrastructures, procedural legibility, and invisible labor
- The rhythms of modernization, decay, repair, and maintenance

**Human–AI Relations, Agents & Delegated Judgment**
- AI-mediated decision pathways in public systems
- Interpretability as shared understanding between humans and agents
- Delegation, error, and the burden of correction
- Media ecologies, automation rituals, and digital publics
