I help governments (and companies) devise manage large-scale digital transformation. From websites to building end-to-end digital products, I've been involved in all sorts of For nearly three years, I've worked on some of the world's biggest problems as part of 18F, an innovation product office within the federal government.

Over the years, my work includes product strategy & digital transformation for complex institutions, CMS migrations, information architecture, user research & service design. I've led teams, and directed digital strategy in the private sector, as well as government.

These days, my practice is focused on interrogating the ways harm is crafted into everyday experiences, and examining new ways for building teams, frameworks, and mental models for reducing friction that ruins experience, centered around a set of principles called Consequence Design.
