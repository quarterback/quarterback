# 👋 Hi, I'm Ron Bronson

I've been building on the internet for nearly 30 years.

Most of my work sits at the intersection of systems, infrastructure, and experience—somewhere between information architecture, service design, and front-end development. These days, I’m focused on devising ways to give context to modern life: how technology reshapes the way we work, play, and engage with each other.

I’m interested in the parts of systems people usually ignore—the seams, handoffs, and broken edges. That’s where the real design work happens.

You can find me writing, building tools, and occasionally hosting events that sit between critical tech, civic life, and culture.
